# Who am i

My name is Lu Wei, or Wayne as English name. I was born in 1989.

In 2012, i graduated from Chengdu University of Information Technology where i studied Computer Science.

I love new tech, love github, keep eyes on AI and love my baby(i got a daughter in 2013 :)).

# Experience

## C/C++

  **In 2012**, i work for Chinasoft International(ICS&S) as my first job.
  And about half a year later, i quit for some private reason(too young too simple).

## Font-End web development

  **2013-2014**, I joined in Chengdu YiMing Technology Co., Ltd as Font-End web developer, using **HTML CSS Javascript**.

  Developing websites for both laptop and mobile phones.

## Back-End web development

  **Now**, i am working for FIH in ChengDu as **Back-End or full stack developer**.

#### Web server

  Develop and maintain web servers in **nodejs**, and using **PostgreSQL, Redis**.

#### Desktop Client (base on node-webkit)
  I propose my superior to use **node-webkit** to build Desktop Clients for Recycling Iphones project, instead of outsourcing.

  And It works.

  When it start, it will start **listening USB** device changes.

  At the same time it will **check updates** from server.
  It will auto down patches and finish update to new version when it restarted just like the way of **Chrome**.

  When an Iphone is added via USB, it will auto **test the hardware status**.
  And **check FMI and guaranty** from Apple's website.

  Then user/operator need to do some visual check.

  After that it will send all results about this phone to server to get to **assessment price** of it.

  - It communicates with both server and web font end by http/https or websocket.

  - It can also talk to Apps installed in Iphones via USB using TCP socket connections(multiple phones model).

    We build an App run in Iphones to provide a TCP server.

    And then Node-Webkit Client connect to the TCP server via USB cable with some open source tools.

  - Auto incremental update.

    Every release installation file is more than 50MB.

    But it can only download less than 200KB files to finish updating an old release to the newest one.

    To approach that, I used Rsync & Courgette.

    I compiled the source code of **chromium**, and get the Courgette tool which can compare binary code and make patches by disassembling.

    And I write a launcher for it in **C++**(Windows).

    It will read the recent version's path in a specific file and launch the real program.

    Each time it finished update, it will update the path in the file and delete the old release.

  - USB device detection(plug/unplug) wrote in C++.

  - Communicates with Font-End by websocket for reason of separation.

  - Iphone testing (multiple phones model for factory / single model for shop)

  - **Print doc and barcode** without using the browser's features.

    The requirement is printing from HTML in background.

    I use **C++ (Windows)** to develop a command line tool to print images in background.

    First, i use html2canvas to get a base64 image from our Font-End web page.

    Then send the image file to a printer via my print.exe tool.

    print.exe also provide scanning printers. also it is able to choose a printer to print.

#### Android development

  I got familiar with Android development in a week.(When we were lack of Android developer)
  And developed an App for Android. Access to Facebook Whatapp and so on via OAuth.
  And provide some Javascript API for webview.

#### Tools for workmates

  python sublime text plugin and nodejs command line tool for my workmates to replace hardcode, saved lot of time.


#### Recently

  Using three-part source code writing in **PHP** (our company bought it) to build a website for India oriented e-commerce platform.

  Develop and design API for Font-End in PHP.

## Other project

- DDNS

  Developed and deployed a program on my Raspberry Pi in my house.

  To make my home local network dynamic IP address auto update to my DDNS.

  So that, i can access my local network from outside.

  Or use my Proxy Server running on the **Raspberry Pi** anywhere.

  [Here is the code](https://github.com/bestplay/ddnsAsync)

- Proxy

  Build a proxy service in my Raspberry Pi using GAE to break GFW(you don't live in China, you will never understand..)

- Auto refresh resumes

  Develop a robot in by Raspberry Pi to auto login 51job dot com and update my resumes.

- develop a Teris game using assembly language (assembly maltreats me thousands of times, i make it as first lover.)

  It can play as Teris game.

  *"Why are you doing this?"*

  *"Because we can"*

  [Here is the code](https://github.com/bestplay/myprj/blob/master/asm/tetris.asm)


I have learned so many things in my work. Not only tech skills, but also social skills.

Thanks for these great companies i have worked for.


# Next

- Improve my English
- Try Golang
- Do more sports

*Ignore the words belove ...*
# Why

Why am i talking about these tiny or maybe useless project?

Because every great thing consist of little steps.

And live and learn.

What do we live for?

Who knows..

Em, whatever..
